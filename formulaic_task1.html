<h2>Creative writing task </h2>
For this creative writing task, you will be asked to write a short fiction text (as if you were writing an excerpt from a novel) of <u><b>400 to 500 words</b></u>. You will be asked to write about a fictional character doing two things: getting ready and commuting to a location, and a dialogue with another protagonist. This is a creative writing exercise, so feel free to invent things and add details as you see fit, just make sure the conversations are typical for this particular setting. <br>
Click the <b>download button</b> when you are finished.
